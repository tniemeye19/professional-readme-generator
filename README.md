## Tests

For this example you will need to make the following edits to the index.js file:
- Change the contents of the `fs.writeFile` from `('./Develop/dist/README.md, ...` to `(./Develop/test/README-test.md, ...`. This will ensure that when you create the test, it will be placed in the test folder, not the distribution folder. Once you decide to create your own unique README, just replace the code file path with the appropriate file path and README file name you would like. 

Ensure that you have reviewed the Installation and Usage instructions from the above sections.
